# Feeds

Feeds is a privacy focused Reddit client that will eventually allow you to that pull in information streams from various sources on the internet, including social media platforms and RSS feeds. Feeds will not require authentication for services that have a public API and will anonymize your IP address when making requests to and from those that do not, in the best efforts to prevent ad tracking.

**Feeds is a work-in-progress.** Written mostly in SwiftUI, bridging over UIKit (and AppKit) when need be, it targets a native-feeling, solid experience on the iPhone and iPad akin to [Castro](https://blog.supertop.co/post/166084374062/design-details-drag-and-drop) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2020/04/the-ipad-the-keyboard-and-the-mouse/), aiming to be [A Best in Class iOS App](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/a-best-in-class-app/).
