# Feeds

Feeds is a privacy focused “feed reader” that pulls in information streams from various sources on the internet, including social media platforms and — of course — RSS feeds. Feeds will not require authentication for sources that have a public API and will anonymize your IP address when making requests to and from those that do not, in my best efforts to prevent ad tracking. Once the app is complete, you'll be able to organize your sources into different feed categories and use the app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Feeds is written mostly in SwiftUI, bridging over UIKit (and AppKit) when need be. It targets a native-feeling, solid experience on the iPhone akin to [Castro](https://blog.supertop.co/post/166084374062/design-details-drag-and-drop) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2020/04/the-ipad-the-keyboard-and-the-mouse/), aiming to be [A Best in Class iOS App](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/a-best-in-class-app/).
