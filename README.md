# Feeds

Feeds is an Apple-platforms client for [FeedsServer](https://github.com/markmals/FeedsServer) written mostly in SwiftUI, bridging over UIKit (and AppKit) when need be. Currently it targets a native-feeling, solid experience on the iPhone akin to [Castro](https://blog.supertop.co/post/166084374062/design-details-drag-and-drop) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2020/04/the-ipad-the-keyboard-and-the-mouse/), aiming to be [A Best in Class iOS App](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/a-best-in-class-app/).
