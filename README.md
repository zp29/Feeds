# Feeds

Feeds is an Apple-platforms client for [FeedsServer](https://github.com/markmals/FeedsServer) written mostly in UIKit, using SwiftUI for custom views and layouts. Currently it targets a native-feeling, solid experience on the iPhone akin to [Castro](https://blog.supertop.co/post/166084374062/design-details-drag-and-drop) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2020/04/the-ipad-the-keyboard-and-the-mouse/), aiming to be [A Best in Class iOS App](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/a-best-in-class-app/). Eventually I want to also fully support platform-native designs for the iPad and Mac (through [Catalyst](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1282702674404704262)) as well.
